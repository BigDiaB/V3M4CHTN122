Mein Vermächtnis

This is a collection of the tools I created whilst learning lua from 2019 to 2021
I am giving up on lua-game-development and moving on.
I hope this is of use to atleast someone!
(I would not recommend using the chunkloader since it needs a lot of rewriting,
because a lot of functions are not named the same way, like they used to be before 
the refactoring for this repository
